This data originally came from Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library.
As the original source says,

A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

In this project, we will create a model to predict if the tweet is neutral, positive, or negative. In the future, we can leverage such models to flag the tweets for an airline for a customer service agent to reach out and contact the customer.
